        <p><h3><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE STUDY OF THE “GLOCAL” META-<br>
            MODEL: CQU GOING ONLINE IN SINGAPORE</b></h3></p>
            <p>Let us consider the specific example of CQU facilitating learning in<br>
                Singapore.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;CQU was originally offering programs in Singapore using distance<br>
                    education (DE) materials together with local tutorial support – a sort of<br>
                    “supported DE delivery.” This was the original “glocal” model, viz., global<br>
                    learning resources with local learning support/mediation provided by local<br>
                    tutors employed by our Singaporean partner. The penetration of communica-<br>
                    tion and information technology in Singapore is considerably higher than in<br>
                    most of the other CQU learning locations and so it was natural to make this<br>
                    the first location for CQU to offer its programs online.<br>
                    The first, and perhaps most important point to make about the Singapore<br>
                    online project is that it was the result of emergent change. In an evolutionary<br>
                    fashion, CQU added online interactivity and support to what it was already<br>
                    offering in Singapore. Thus, the online programs in Singapore are not offered<br>
                    in a pure online mode of delivery – instead they are offered in “supported<br>
                    online mode,” i.e., with some printed DE materials, some face-to-face<br>
                    tutorials and other campus-based support. This “supported online mode” is<br>
                    simply an example of the flexible learning paradigm embraced by the<br>
                    University, or more specifically, an example of the “glocal networked<br>
                    learning paradigm.”<br>
                    The communication and information technologies which enable us to<br>
                    create the networked learning environment for the student also enable us to<br>
                    create a networked education system in which lecturers, tutors and teaching<br>
                    resources are all linked. In the CQU/Singapore network, a CQU academic<br>
                    development team is responsible for the collection of the resources, the<br>
                    creation of the materials and the development of the “global core” for the<br>
                    supported online course. The global core is then electronically delivered to the<br>
                    local partner in Singapore.<br>
                    The local partner in Singapore is responsible for adding the local<br>
                    education interface to the global core (see Figure 2). Thus, the online<br>
                    component of the global core is mirrored on our partner’s server in Singapore<br>
                    and the local partner then creates a website with the required local online<br>
                    “look and feel.” The CQU academic development team works electronically<br>
                    with the local development team to maintain quality control of this locally<br>
                    added component</p><br>

                    <img src="d1.PNG">
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the facilitation of learning during the running of a particular<br>
                        course, a lecturer on one Central Queensland campus is designated as the<br>
                        coordinator of a particular unit (course), and that person, together with the<br>
                        administration multi-campus support team, coordinates the activities of the<br>
                        learning facilitators/tutors on all the other campuses on which that particular<br>
                        course is taught. Thus, rather than dealing directly with a thousand students<br>
                        on campuses all over the world, the CQU coordinator deals with the in-<br>
                        country tutors who in turn facilitate the learning of the students. The local<br>
                        campus/centre acts as a hub – a local network – as shown in Figure 3.<br>
                        Through the coordinator, CQU is responsible for quality control of the<br>
                        facilitation of the learning process. The usual quality control mechanisms are<br>
                        used, including moderation of assignments, marking of examination scripts,<br>
                        and site management visits</p><br>
                        <p><h3><b>CONCLUDING REMARKS</b></h3></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this chapter, the authors have identified forces leading to change in<br>
                            industries in the online world, including increasing global competition,<br>
                            increasingly powerful consumers and rapid changes in technology, especially<br>
                            those related to telecommunications. Implications for industry include mar-<br>
                            ket transformations, the need for alliances, changes in outsourcing behavior,<br>
                            the need for re-engineering, and changes in the role and type of intermediaries.<br>
                            </p>

                            <img src="d2.PNG">
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the higher education industry, pressures for change include global<br>
                                competition and technology-facilitated learning. Outcomes are evolving, but<br>
                                include the formation of alliances, outsourcing and re-engineering of systems<br>
                                and work practices. In particular, the communication and information tech-<br>
                                nologies that facilitate networked learning also link lecturers, tutors, and<br>
                                teaching resources to create the possibility of networked education.<br>
                               &nbsp;&nbsp; The particular “glocal” networked education paradigm that the authors<br>
                                have outlined separates out four functions:<br>
                                1) Development of the global core of learning resources;<br>
                                2) Development of the local education interface;<br>
                                3) Coordination of the learning facilitation on a specific occasion; and<br>
                                4) Local learning facilitation.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;    An important distinction here for CQU is the separation of the develop-<br>
                                ment and the teaching functions. By embracing this separation, CQU has been<br>
                                able to develop ways of working which allow the creation of a scalable and<br>
                                flexible model. In this model, however, the work of the university academic<br>
                                is changed considerably.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;    The authors have shown how the online world tends to lead to vertical<br>
                                disintegration in universities and results in the differentiated functions being<br>
                                performed by alliance partners or being outsourced. In the same way, the<br>
                                functions traditionally performed by a single university academic are differ-<br>
                                entiated in the CQU “glocal” networked education paradigm and are per</p><br>
                                <hr>
                                <p>formed by a network of learning facilitators. The distinction between aca-<br>
                                    demic and nonacademic university staff blurs as both take on more “learning<br>
                                    management” roles, for example, management of learning facilitators and<br>
                                    management of learning resources. In this scenario, university academics may<br>
                                    find themselves responsible for the learning of hundreds of students. They<br>
                                    may never, however, find themselves face-to-face with a single student.</p><br>
